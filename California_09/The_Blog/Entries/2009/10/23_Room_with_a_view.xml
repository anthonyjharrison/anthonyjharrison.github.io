    <richText>&lt;b&gt;As we woke up to a slightly over cast morning the day seemed to present only one option - time to shop online for prospective engagement rings!&#xD;&#xD;Thankfully, for the sake of a certain person&#x2019;s bank account, the cloud burnt off and the weather became perfect. We revised our plans and booked a boat cruise across Lake Tahoe taking in the major sight of yesterday - Emerald Bay. In conjunction with the bay we took a sneak peek at some of the multi million dollar mansions scattered across the shore - certainly impressive and great to get a few ideas should we ever win the lottery. &#xD;&#xD;The cruise presented some breathtaking views and a chance to be out on the water and enjoy this great location from another perspective!&#xD;&#xD;Check out a few more additional photo&#x2019;s in the Lake Tahoe picture album &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/EBC6B8F4-B113-4292-9681-665772485156"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
