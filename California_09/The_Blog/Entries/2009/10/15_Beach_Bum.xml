    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Blessed by a touch of nice weather the crew decided to take in the sights of the beaches south of LA. &#xD;&#xD;Whilst not quite hot enough for a swim we managed to fit in breakfast in Manhattan Beach, lunch at Hermosa Beach and dinner all the way down south in Newport Beach (not all in the same day mind you).&#xD;&#xD;Our patch of nice weather was short lived unfortunately. We have been told that it hasn&#x2019;t rained in LA during the month of October since 1966. Pity it decided to buck the trend during our trip and drizzled, bucketed and stormed for about 36 hours straight!&#xD;&#xD;The rain pushes the tourists inside and the homeless out into the open giving an entirely new light on Santa Monica that we all agree has to be the homeless capital of the world!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
