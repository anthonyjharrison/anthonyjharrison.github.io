    <richText>The Loire Valley is a beautiful site with lush green fields, colourful autumn trees, majestic century old towns and old Frenchmen weeing on the side of the road. Well maybe not the last bit but it does get Felicity excited!&#xD;&#xD;We decided to amend our previous plan and, after spending just one night in Nantes, we left for Tours. We stopped off at Saumur along the way for some stunning views and our first outdoor French market! We managed to survive without buying anything.&#xD;&#xD;Arriving in Tours we squeezed our car into a park - no lubrication necessary, located a hotel and managed to make it through an entire meal without speaking a word of English to the waitress - we are still not sure what we ate!&#xD;&#xD;Our last full day in the area was spent looking at very large and expensive properties - pity about the credit crunch as we would have loved to finance ourselves a slice! We smelt the flowers and admired the vegies at Villandry, marvelled at the size of Chambord and (with great difficulty) avoided all the Americans at Chenonceau. &#xD;&#xD;We&#x2019;re enjoying the way of life here. The French seem to be late starters as everywhere is pretty much a ghost town until well after 10am. There&#x2019;s nothing like wandering along the empty cobbled streets, brioche in one hand, camera in the other!</richText>
