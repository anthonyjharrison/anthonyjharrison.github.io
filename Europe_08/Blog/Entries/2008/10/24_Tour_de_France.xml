    <richText>On the way to Saint Tropez we drove a good portion of the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.letour.fr/2009/TDF/COURSE/us/200/etape_par_etape.html"&gt;Monaco to Brignoles&lt;/a&gt; leg of the 2009 Tour de France. God knows why Lance Armstrong wants to come out of retirement - Felicity and I broke out in a sweat and we were conquering it in a car. Maybe it was due to the fact we were following footsteps of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Vatanen"&gt;Ari Vatanen&lt;/a&gt; and taking the stage as he did &lt;a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3368948773832597270"&gt;Pikes Peak&lt;/a&gt; compounded with the fact the mountainous road was minus barriers!&#xD;&#xD;Following the blistering time set during the rally stage we dined a hero&#x2019;s lunch (pity we didn&#x2019;t get a hero&#x2019;s reception) in St Maxime before heading around the coast to Saint Tropez. &#xD;&#xD;Apparently Bridget Bardot made Saint Tropez famous for a raunchy film set in the 50&#x2019;s. Didn&#x2019;t see much resembling that kind of behaviour but it a nice little town - somewhat influenced by tourists and the million dollars worth of cruisers sitting in the harbour. &#xD;&#xD;</richText>
