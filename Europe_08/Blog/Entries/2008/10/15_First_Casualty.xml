    <richText>Roll out the red carpet and unleash champagne from the heavens. We managed to split the 500 Euro note!&#xD;&#x2028;Now that we are all cashed up we can add a star to the accommodation rating (to actually having one) and extend our diets beyond the food we purchased at Carrefoure (the popular French hyper market) at the start of the trip.&#xD;&#xD;Following the excitement of finally having access to our money we ventured out to celebrate the only way we know how - eating! The first lesson we learnt in this respect is always take a comprehensive dictionary out to dinner and never rely on the English menu. The first casualty of the trip so far is Felicity&#x2019;s stomach. Ordering what she thought was spicy sausage and mash was in fact a variety of andouillette - pork tripe sausage. I have to give her credit for eating a fair chunk of it - maybe this was due to the fact I was on the other side of the table trying to coax her into thinking it was chicken! Anyway Rick Stein would be proud of her! From what she tells me it tasted slightly better on the way up than it did going down!</richText>
