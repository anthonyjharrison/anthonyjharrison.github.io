    <richText>Well we&#x2019;ve finally made it! Close to 36 hours pasted between the time we left our front door to when we walked into our B&amp;B in Lille. To say we were tired was an absolute understatement.&#xD;&#xD;But it was all worth it. Lille is a gorgeous city with some historic charm and some pretty tempting shopping to boot. Lucky our packs are already full or we could have been blowing our budget on the first day.&#xD;&#x2028;Bit of a short kickoff blog post but turning in early as we are off to Caen tomorrow (after picking up the wheels) to check out the sights and sounds of Normandy. Looking forward to getting behind the wheel and showing the French how real drivers drive.... on the left! :)</richText>
