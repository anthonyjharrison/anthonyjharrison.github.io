    <richText>During our visit to Narbonne we were lucky enough to enjoy our first real experience of a French food market. Whilst similar in part to what we enjoy in Melbourne it is of interest witnessing the differing variety of food available here in France. We bypassed the tripe outlet (Felicity is still a little raw) but absorbed all the rest. The huge difference is the lack of glass between the produce and the customer. Everything is slap bang in your face ready to sample!&#xD;&#xD;No exciting stories to share over the last few days. Our dinners have been reasonably successful with the inclusion of two phrase books! Toll charges have dropped dramatically as have the driving distances. Looking forward to the next week in the south of France. Bonjour le Soleil! (translation: Hello Sun)</richText>
