    <richText>Extending from the shenanigans collectively had in Paris the awesome foursome ventured to Andrew and Mariann&#x2019;s homeland of Bergen, Norway to cause more mayhem. As seen above much time was spent in the supermarkets marvelling at the cultural food differences. Apart from frozen whale another interesting item is Bog in a can. If I knew it was such a hot item I would have put mine in a tin a long time ago!!&#xD;&#xD;Its been an amazing few days taking in Bergen and living like the locals. We&#x2019;ve been hiking in the mountains, eating salmon and wearing enough gortex and thermal layers to make the Michelin Man look thin!&#xD;&#xD;Bergen is a great city and with it&#x2019;s many similarities to Hobart and Canada combined with the Barry&#x2019;s/Solberg&#x2019;s being exceptionally generous and welcoming it truly feels like a slice of home sixteen and a half thousand kilometres away!&#xD;</richText>
