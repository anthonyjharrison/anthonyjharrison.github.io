    <richText>With the holiday nearing the end it was time to drop by the great mother land to spend some hard earned coin on some top quality English threads! Coupled with this we&#x2019;ve also managed to take in a few tourist sites, catch up with some great friends and spend an inordinate amount of time on the London underground!&#xD;&#xD;Although not presented with the best weather (what do you really expect for London in November) it has been an enjoyable conclusion to the trip to wander through the shops and catch up with some great friends not seen for a long time!&#xD;&#xD;Now time to cram the purchases into our overflowing bags, catch the tube to Paddington and check out what the new British Airways Terminal 5 has to offer - hopefully more than the expected delays and lost luggage that the papers have us to believe!&#xD;&#xD;See you all soon!</richText>
