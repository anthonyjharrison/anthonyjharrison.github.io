    <richText>Thankfully my extremely poor French can be laid to rest, as today we headed out of French speaking &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"&gt;Quebec&lt;/a&gt; and arrived in the English provence of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"&gt;Ontario&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;After a sad farewell to Sarah, Lora and their partners, Steph, Felicity, James and I drove a mammoth 700 odd kilometers from Montreal to Niagara Falls. (We shouldn&#x2019;t complain though as Sarah and Sean had to drive 12 hours back to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax%2C_Nova_Scotia"&gt;Halifax&lt;/a&gt;) Time was tight as we were hoping to make the final &lt;a href="http://www.maidofthemist.com/en/"&gt;Maid of the Mist&lt;/a&gt; at 4.45pm. James suffered the pain of driving the whole distance and due to the constraints the girls had to go without bathroom breaks!! Ouch! We ended up arriving a matter of minutes too late. After the 6 hour drive it was disappointing to miss out but we didn&#x2019;t let it get us down. We took a &lt;a href="http://www.niagaraparks.com/nfgg/behindthefalls.php"&gt;Journey Behind the Falls&lt;/a&gt; which was unforgettable. After traversing a number of tunnels that wound their way behind the wall of water, open air portholes provided amazing views and the thunderous sound vibrated through the tunnel walls.&#xD;&#xD;We even hung around to catch a glimpse of the falls at night.</richText>
