    <richText>There is so much free Internet in Seattle it&#x2019;s no wonder Tom and Meg suffered insomnia - good news that we could finally post our blog!! &#xD;&#xD;Although our stay here in Seattle is short its still been a lot of fun. Friday we headed over to Redmond where Felicity shopped and I had the enjoyment of having lunch on Bill Gates. No doubt he didn&#x2019;t miss that $9.95! &#xD;&#xD;Today&#x2019;s excitement revolved around flying to the top of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle"&gt;Space Needle&lt;/a&gt;. Although it&#x2019;s nowhere near a tall as the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cn_tower"&gt;CN Tower&lt;/a&gt; (1815 feet vs 605) it&#x2019;s still provides just as impressive views of the city skyline. The weather provided a perfect day to take it all in as well! I&#x2019;m just glad that it doesn&#x2019;t have a glass floor as I left my brown undies back in Toronto!&#xD;&#xD;During our quick Seattle stop over we also got to visit the first ever &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks_Coffee"&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; store and we also caught a glimpse of the famous Seattle fish throwers at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market"&gt;Pike Place Market&lt;/a&gt;.</richText>
