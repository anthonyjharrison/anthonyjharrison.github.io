    <richText>The road heading north from Banff to Jasper would have to be one of the most picturesque roadways I&#x2019;ve ever been on. The drive is only 200km but it takes most of the day due to the fact you have to take happy snaps around every bend.&#xD;&#xD;One of the key attractions on the drive north is the Columbia Icefield (fortunately for us this is not a cocaine plantation in South America) and in particular the Athabasca Glacier.&#xD;&#xD;The main photo on the left is taken at the current toe of the Athabasca Glacier looking down the hill to land that the glacier used to occupy. The white dot that I&#x2019;ve Photoshop&#x2019;d onto the photo shows where the glacier stood in 1982 (the year that both Felicity and I were born). Not sure if it conveys just how far down this sign is but we can assure you its a good 15 to 20 minute uphill hike. Pretty amazing how quickly this is melting. Apparently it&#x2019;s due to global warming and the greenhouse effect and scientists say that the glacier will be no longer in 100 years time. Better make that 98 as no doubt the emissions from our rental car has knocked a good couple of years of its lifespan!&#xD;&#xD;Further north we spotted a female black bear with three cubs snacking on some berries by the road. We have now been lucky enough to see bears on four separate occasions whilst on the trip. If the blog suddenly goes quiet chances are we ran out of luck on our fifth encounter!</richText>
