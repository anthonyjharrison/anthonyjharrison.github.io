    <richText>Bienvenue vers Montr&#xE9;al!&#xD;&#xD;Today marked our first day in Montreal. We arrived late last night and after dropping our gear off we caught up with some fantastic old friends of mine Steph, James, Sarah and Sean (who we met for the first time). We had a great night out on a crazy night in Montreal. There is no doubt something in the water here, as Montreal people sure know how to have fun. Groups of happy drunk people roamed the streets and there was most certain a distinct party atmosphere.&#xD;&#xD;Today was a little more low key. We spent the day touring around historic &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Montreal"&gt;Old Montreal&lt;/a&gt; taking in the old colonial building, monuments and fountains. Apart from having fantastic company and roaming the streets of a really funky town it was just amazing to have decent weather!!</richText>
