    <richText>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_and_ernie"&gt;Bert and Ernie&lt;/a&gt; would be mighty jealous of the amount of sea-life we&#x2019;ve seen so far in Maui. There was most certainly no need to use their &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFTjeaDlxDI"&gt;infamous fish calling technique&lt;/a&gt;. We&#x2019;ve been blessed with a whole array of fish and yesterday we even snorkeled with a Sea Turtle. All this is just off the beach in front of the apartment! Pretty crazy stuff!&#xD;&#xD;We&#x2019;ve been really lucky with the weather ever since our arrival on Sunday. We met up with Mum and Dad who&#x2019;ve been on holiday on the islands since the previous Thursday. They&#x2019;ve got a great head start on their tan but Felicity has given them a good run for their money in the last couple of days! It&#x2019;s going to be a tight competition but I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll come through with the goods. &#xD;&#xD;We&#x2019;ve been staying in the new apartment that mum and dad purchased last year and it&#x2019;s amazing! We&#x2019;ve even giving the kiddy water slide a bit of a workout (Dad included).&#xD;&#x2028;The plan for the rest of the week is more tanning, snorkeling and sipping Pina Colada&#x2019;s by the pool. We&#x2019;ll post more photo&#x2019;s of these strenuous activities once we get a chance!</richText>
