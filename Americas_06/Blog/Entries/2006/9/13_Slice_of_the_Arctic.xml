    <richText>We just can&#x2019;t seem to get enough of this frozen water stuff. Yesterday we were walking on a glacier, today we&#x2019;re swimming in a lake filled with ice bergs. Ok so we didn&#x2019;t quite go swimming but we did stick our arms in! Trust us it was pretty cold.&#xD;&#xD;Mt Edith Cavell is about an hours drive from Jasper and has an amazing asset. At the foot of the glacier pinned to its cliffs is a pool of icy water complimented with hundreds of miniature ice bergs. Throw in a few penguins and we could have mistaken it for Antarctica, throw in a massive chunk of lemon and I&#x2019;d mistake it for a gin and tonic!</richText>
