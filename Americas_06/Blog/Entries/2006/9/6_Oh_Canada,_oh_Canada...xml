    <richText>Well if you&#x2019;re up for a party Montreal is the place to be. Our weekend in the second largest city in Canada proved to be a blast. Saturday saw the addition of Lora and her boyfriend Colin to take our tally to nine crazy souls in the &#x2018;City of Saints&#x2019;.&#xD;&#xD;We resisted the temptation to visit many of Montreal&#x2019;s male entertainment establishments but managed to find enough entertainment to keep us occupied during the evening. We especially had a great night at &lt;a href="http://www.go-montreal.com/carlos_pepes/"&gt;Carlos and Pepe&#x2019;s &lt;/a&gt;(authentic Montreal cuisine) and thought their choice of music was uncannily familiar.&#xD;&#xD;Culture was on the cards for Sunday&#x2019;s activities and to get our fix we headed to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph's_Oratory"&gt;St Joseph's Oratory of Mont Royal&lt;/a&gt;. Word is that its dome is the second largest of its kind (100 points who can name the first!!).</richText>
