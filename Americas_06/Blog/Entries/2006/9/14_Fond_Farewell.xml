    <richText>Our wonderful Canadian adventures have drawn to a close. Today marked our last full day trekking through the Rockies, as tomorrow we start our journey back to the west coast of the United States!&#xD;&#xD;On our last day here we headed to Maligne Lake and Maligne Canyon. The lake and canyon are the largest of their type in the Rockies. I was a probably a little keen donning shorts this morning as it has started to get a bit chilly. Didn&#x2019;t stop us from having an energetic day trekking around the tranquil lake and fighting off annoying tourists at the canyon.  Snow is forecast for overnight - who knows what sights we&#x2019;ll wake up to!</richText>
