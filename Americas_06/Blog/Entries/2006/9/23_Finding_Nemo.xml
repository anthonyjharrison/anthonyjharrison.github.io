    <richText>During our snorkel trip to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molokini"&gt;Molokini&lt;/a&gt; today we finally found a famous Hollywood actor. Low and behold it was Gill star fish in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Nemo"&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/a&gt; movie! We were so stoked! No point obtaining his autograph (the poor guy couldn&#x2019;t hold a pen in his fin) so we just threw him on the grill. Didn&#x2019;t know &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_Idol"&gt;Moorish Idol&lt;/a&gt; made such good eating!&#xD;&#xD;Enough jokes aside Molokini was an absolute blast. Visibility was amazing - you could see for metres and metres!! The fish were super friendly and were pretty happy to get up close and personal with you. Other snorkelers saw a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_Ray"&gt;Manta Ray&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitetip_reef_shark"&gt;Whitetip Reef Shark&lt;/a&gt;. Glad we didn&#x2019;t come across either of these puppies - sharks scare the bejesus out of me and we all know that Manta Rays and Australian&#x2019;s don&#x2019;t mix!</richText>
