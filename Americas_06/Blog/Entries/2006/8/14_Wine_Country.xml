    <richText>Before our trip to &lt;a href="http://www.sonoma.com/"&gt;Sonoma&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.napavalley.com/"&gt;Napa Valley&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday the only Californian Wine I&#x2019;d ever sampled was out of a cardboard box. Rachel and Darren organised a fantastic day for us. We headed out early morning to Sonoma where we had a true American breakfast at an establishment called the &lt;a href="http://www.bearcountrystore.com/"&gt;Black Bear Diner&lt;/a&gt;. It was a true education in good old American heart starting food. At the risk of copping flack for talking about food again I won&#x2019;t go into details. Lets just say after breakfast none of us needed to eat for at least a month!&#xD;&#x2028;Sonoma is such a pretty town. Just out of the city centre we drove down winery alley past &lt;a href="http://www.brcohn.com/"&gt;B.R Cohn&lt;/a&gt; which is owned by the &lt;a href="http://www.doobiebros.com/"&gt;Doobie Brothers&lt;/a&gt; and dropped into &lt;a href="http://www.chateaustjean.com/stjean/home.jsp"&gt;Chateau St Jean&lt;/a&gt; whose landscaping and architecture seemed to be modelled around European wineries of earlier vintage. It was truly amazing. There are a couple of pics in the &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/DF64647C-BA0C-4409-9AC0-AAB86C142203"&gt;photo gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;After the wine tour we all headed to &lt;a href="http://www.sonoma-county.org/PARKS/pk_slake.htm"&gt;Spring Lake Park&lt;/a&gt; to sample some of Sonoma&#x2019;s finest (the wine was a &lt;a href="http://www.benziger.com/"&gt;Benziger&lt;/a&gt;) along with a picnic that Rachel and Darren had prepared.&#xD;&#xD;It was such a fantastic day and it caped off a great weekend that we had with Felicity&#x2019;s cousins. Rachel and Darren were great fun and it was sad to say goodbye. No doubt we&#x2019;ll see them soon in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_Bora"&gt;Bora Bora&lt;/a&gt;!!</richText>
