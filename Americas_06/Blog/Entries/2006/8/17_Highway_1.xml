    <richText>We&#x2019;ve just pulled stumps on the first day of our two day drive down the coast. So many of our friends and family encouraged us to take this drive. With delays expected both on the train and at the airport it seemed common sense to hit the road. We, well actually just me - Felicity slept most of the way, had an amazing drive down.  We left San Francisco at around 10am aided with some pretty impressive directions from Felicity&#x2019;s cousin (thanks heaps Rachel).&#xD;&#xD;Our drive took us through some pretty coastal towns, amazing scenery and unexpected encounters with some playful wildlife!&#xD;&#xD;Our first major destination was a lunch stop at &lt;a href="http://www.monterey.com/"&gt;Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. This little town is a happening place. Whilst enjoying some pretty tasty seafood on the restaurant balcony we were entertained by some playful sea lions (or seals - unsure what sea mammal they were) in the marina. These guys were crazy.&#xD;&#xD;After Monterey we dropped in and hit a few balls with &lt;a href="http://www.tigerwoods.com/splash/splash.sps"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.pebblebeach.com/"&gt;Pebble Beach&lt;/a&gt;. He seems to have developed a little slice, so after a few coaching lessons I had him pretty much cured of that issue. Pity now he has a nasty case of the shanks.&#xD;&#x2028;Just out of &lt;a href="http://www.carmelcalifornia.com/"&gt;Carmel&lt;/a&gt; the drive descended south to the &lt;a href="http://www.bigsurcalifornia.org/"&gt;Big Sur&lt;/a&gt; area. The pictures at the top of this entry were all taken along this coastline. As you can see we had another fabulous day and the pics turned out pretty darn well. Check out the new pics &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/6AFB1A4E-8B79-4B11-B0CB-221DA78E4309"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;Towards the end of our 240 mile drive before our detour to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearst_Castle"&gt;Hearst Castle&lt;/a&gt; we stumbled across more wildlife. Since 1990 a number of Elephant Seals have made a stretch of the &lt;a href="http://www.sansimeonsbest.com/"&gt;San Simeon&lt;/a&gt; coastline home. We were lucky enough that a few were catching some rays and didn&#x2019;t mind us taking a few happy snaps of them kicking back.&#xD;&#xD;Our day has ended at our pit stop - &lt;a href="http://www.ci.san-luis-obispo.ca.us/"&gt;San Luis Obispo&lt;/a&gt;. Cute little town with really funky pedestrian crossings. When they detect a pedestrian the whole crosswalk lights up like a disco. Quite bizarre but provided us with entertainment for the evening.</richText>
