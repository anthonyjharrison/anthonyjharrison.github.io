    <richText>Well our arrival in Las Vegas didn&#x2019;t go as smoothly as we&#x2019;d hoped. Our plans were to check into our reserved room at the world&#x2019;s largest hotel - The MGM Grand. Looks like management decided to overbook the hotel so we were informed that we would be staying one night over the road in the Hooters Casino Hotel. It was hard to argue with the lady cause I was laughing so much. Can&#x2019;t believe Hooters has a casino!&#xD;&#xD;Anyway after I&#x2019;d settled down and had a chance to change my shorts we wandered over the road to the &#x2018;delightfully tacky, yet unrefined&#x2019; Hooters establishment.&#xD;&#xD;First thing I wanted to do was hook Felicity up in some bright orange tight footy shorts and a busty white singlet. I was thinking that if she could blend in I could get a few free drinks and maybe a line of credit on the roulette table!! Understandably she was not as keen on the idea as I was.</richText>
