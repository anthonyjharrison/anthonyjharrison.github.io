    <richText>To all the people that recommended San Francisco&#x2019;s Seafood &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam_chowder"&gt;Chowder&lt;/a&gt; in Sourdough - THANKYOU! &#xD;&#xD;Brilliant. Nuff said.&#xD;&#xD;Today marked Felicity&#x2019;s arrival to the United States (new highlight of the trip). After a week of flying solo I finally have a travel companion and I&#x2019;m absolutely over the moon. The added security brought about by the recent terrorist arrests meant that Fliss had to jump through a few more hoops than usual but other than that she&#x2019;s arrived safe and sound in fantastic San Francisco.&#xD;&#xD;Apart from a pretty stiff westerly wind it was another glorious day. After a quick stroll around the Fisherman&#x2019;s Wharf we headed out on a quick cruise around the bay. Don&#x2019;t forget to drop by and see the new additions to &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/DF64647C-BA0C-4409-9AC0-AAB86C142203"&gt;San Fran Pics&lt;/a&gt;.&#xD;&#xD;WWDC has now concluded and with that I can quite confidently say that nerd entries will now desist. In turn hopefully this marks the beginning of interesting blog entries and entertaining photos!</richText>
