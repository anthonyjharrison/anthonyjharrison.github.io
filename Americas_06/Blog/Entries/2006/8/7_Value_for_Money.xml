    <richText>With the ridiculous price of bananas back home I thought I&#x2019;d sample a couple of California&#x2019;s finest for breakfast. Well I&#x2019;ve done the sums and it seems better value to fly to California and eat them than to pick up a hand at Woolies. Ok a little exaggeration...&#xD;&#xD;Again another fabulous San Francisco day. I noticed in the mirror this morning that due to having a blonde moment yesterday and forgetting to wear sunscreen my face now resembles the colour of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_orange"&gt;Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Ouch.. Flick if you read this bring &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_Vera"&gt;Aloe Vera&lt;/a&gt;!!&#xD;&#xD;My morning took me aboard a &lt;a href="http://www.sfmuni.com/cms/mms/home/home50.htm"&gt;SF electric bus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamo_Square"&gt;Alamo Square&lt;/a&gt; where I sat and had a nice breakfast overlooking the city skyline and the famous &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies"&gt;Painted Ladies&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn&#x2019;t caught public transport in years so it was a bit of a learning experience. I jumped off at the wrong stop and photographed what I thought was the famous San Francisco landmark. Whilst sitting down enjoying my &lt;a href="http://www.walgreens.com/"&gt;Walgreens&lt;/a&gt; breakfast I noticed a billion (again a little exaggeration) tour buses going straight past what I thought was the infamous San Francisco &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_house"&gt;Victorian&lt;/a&gt; houses. Here I am thinking that those suckers don&#x2019;t even have the pleasure of stepping off the bus for a photograph. A bit stiff for the $US28 they paid. Anyway after finishing up my meal I thought I&#x2019;d walk through the park and see what else was around. A two minute stroll through a couple of paths and over a mound I found the real ladies.... and about 100,000 Japanese Tourists (no exaggeration).&#xD;&#xD;This morning I also wandered down and registered for the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/"&gt;WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. I woke up early so I decided to get down there first thing. Being a tourist I took a couple of &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/80EBB278-9AEF-4748-A817-CB9F5AEF6F4B"&gt;photo&#x2019;s&lt;/a&gt;. Place looks wicked, can&#x2019;t wait for the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/guide/appleevents/"&gt;Keynote&lt;/a&gt; address tomorrow from my mate &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs"&gt;Steve&lt;/a&gt;. &#xD;&#xD;FYI - I&#x2019;ve also added a couple of new &lt;a href="perma://BLPageReference/DF64647C-BA0C-4409-9AC0-AAB86C142203"&gt;San Fran Pics&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!</richText>
