    <richText>Today we managed to meet one of the world biggest tennis stars - &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova"&gt;Maria Sharapova&lt;/a&gt;.We were pretty lucky that she was looking for a little bit of a warm up before her hit out at the US Open later today. They had a radar gun to clock the speed of our serves. Flick reached 45 miles per hour and I wasn&#x2019;t far off the pace with a 88 miles per hour. The bloke told me that a number of my serves were too quick for the radar. I was pretty impressed about that! And before you ask let&#x2019;s not talk about accuracy!</richText>
