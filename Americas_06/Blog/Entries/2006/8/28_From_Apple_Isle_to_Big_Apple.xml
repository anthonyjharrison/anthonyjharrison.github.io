    <richText>Today was a dark and rainy day here in New York City. But for one thing it hasn&#x2019;t dampened our shopping spirit. Even at its weather worst New York is a blast. Today we headed up to the top of &lt;a href="http://www.topoftherocknyc.com/ODTStatic/site.htm"&gt;Rockefeller Centre&lt;/a&gt;. On route the weather gave us a little unexpected shower, but never-mind, at least we weren&#x2019;t participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.nyrr.org/nychalf/home.php"&gt;New York Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt; that was being held at the same time. Even on a bleak day the views were spectacular, and the positive was that we had the whole observation deck to ourselves! To keep dry we had to take cover in a number of shops and department stores (very bad for the budget - please send money!). Needless to say I can no longer fit everything in my bag and Felicity has yet another pair of shoes.&#xD;&#xD;Tomorrow we are off to see the Statue of Liberty. Forecast is for more inclement weather but at least we&#x2019;ve dug out mum and dad&#x2019;s rain jackets. They proved their weight this afternoon!</richText>
