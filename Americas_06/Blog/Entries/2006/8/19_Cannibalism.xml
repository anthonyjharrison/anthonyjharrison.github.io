    <richText>Thanks to a couple of popular TV shows the coastal towns of &lt;a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/laguna_beach/series.jhtml#/ontv/dyn/laguna_beach/series.jhtml"&gt;Laguna Beach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.fox.com/oc/"&gt;Newport Beach&lt;/a&gt; have become a somewhat household name amongst people of Felicity and my generation. So why wouldn&#x2019;t we just grab our swimmers and head to the beach. Its not like we can go out and rack up a bill on my VISA card. Some other bloke has had fun doing that on the other side of the globe.&#xD;&#xD;In hindsight we probably underestimated the heat of the Californian sun. The only thing brighter than us at dinner was the lobster that we were devouring! It was the first time we have found non-Australian lobster on a menu. Completely blew our budget but not to mind. My emergency VISA card arrives tomorrow! Hello &lt;a href="http://www.shopfashionisland.com/"&gt;Fashion Island&lt;/a&gt;...</richText>
