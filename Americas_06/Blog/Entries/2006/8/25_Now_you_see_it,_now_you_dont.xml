    <richText>On a spur of the moment decision we decided to go and catch &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Copperfield_(illusionist)"&gt;David Copperfield&#x2019;s&lt;/a&gt; opening act at the MGM Grand. The original plan was to enquire at the desk about session times on our way to dinner. The 7.30pm session was due to start in a couple of minutes so after zero consideration we jumped on board. The guy hooked us up with some wicked tickets a couple of rows from the front.&#xD;&#xD;Well the show was fantastic. We both had a blast. To cap it off both of us were selected to go up on stage and participate in two separate acts. At the end of the show Felicity was even lucky enough to go backstage to meet the master himself. As you can see above we even got a couple of autographed photo&#x2019;s to take home!!&#xD;&#xD;On other good news MGM management has given us a complimentary nights stay here at the hotel to use in the next 12 months. Guess Felicity and I will have to come back soon to renew our vows!</richText>
