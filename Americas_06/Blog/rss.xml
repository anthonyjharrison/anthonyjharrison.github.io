Today we travelled to Surfing Mecca - North Shore Oahu. Here we took in three of the most infamous beaches on the island - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Beach_%28Oahu%29&quot;&gt;Sunset&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waimea_Bay&quot;&gt;Waimea Bay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzai_Pipeline&quot;&gt;Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;. Although the surf was pretty quiet neither of us wanted to take our chances in the water. I doubt our travel insurance would cover any North Shore surfing injuries!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our other highlight of the day is that at our lunch spot we spotted the actor that plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Sucre&quot;&gt;Fernando Sucre&lt;/a&gt; from the TV series &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison_Break&quot;&gt;Prison Break&lt;/a&gt;. Felicity and I were both to gutless to ask for his autograph but we got to sit at the table that they dined at!</description>

Low and behold it was Gill star fish in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Nemo&quot;&gt;Finding Nemo&lt;/a&gt; movie! We were so stoked! No point obtaining his autograph (the poor guy couldn’t hold a pen in his fin) so we just threw him on the grill. Didn’t know &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moorish_Idol&quot;&gt;Moorish Idol&lt;/a&gt; made such good eating!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enough jokes aside Molokini was an absolute blast. Visibility was amazing - you could see for metres and metres!! The fish were super friendly and were pretty happy to get up close and personal with you. Other snorkelers saw a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manta_Ray&quot;&gt;Manta Ray&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitetip_reef_shark&quot;&gt;Whitetip Reef Shark&lt;/a&gt;. Glad we didn’t come across either of these puppies - sharks scare the bejesus out of me and we all know that Manta Rays and Australian’s don’t mix!</description>

There was most certainly no need to use their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFTjeaDlxDI&quot;&gt;infamous fish calling technique&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been blessed with a whole array of fish and yesterday we even snorkeled with a Sea Turtle. All this is just off the beach in front of the apartment! Pretty crazy stuff!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We’ve been really lucky with the weather ever since our arrival on Sunday. We met up with Mum and Dad who’ve been on holiday on the islands since the previous Thursday. They’ve got a great head start on their tan but Felicity has given them a good run for their money in the last couple of days! It’s going to be a tight competition but I’m sure she’ll come through with the goods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We’ve been staying in the new apartment that mum and dad purchased last year and it’s amazing! We’ve even giving the kiddy water slide a bit of a workout (Dad included).&lt;br/&gt; The plan for the rest of the week is more tanning, snorkeling and sipping Pina Colada’s by the pool. We’ll post more photo’s of these strenuous activities once we get a chance!</description>

Friday we headed over to Redmond where Felicity shopped and I had the enjoyment of having lunch on Bill Gates. No doubt he didn’t miss that $9.95! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today’s excitement revolved around flying to the top of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle&quot;&gt;Space Needle&lt;/a&gt;. Although it’s nowhere near a tall as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cn_tower&quot;&gt;CN Tower&lt;/a&gt; (1815 feet vs 605) it’s still provides just as impressive views of the city skyline. The weather provided a perfect day to take it all in as well! I’m just glad that it doesn’t have a glass floor as I left my brown undies back in Toronto!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During our quick Seattle stop over we also got to visit the first ever &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks_Coffee&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/a&gt; store and we also caught a glimpse of the famous Seattle fish throwers at &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Place_Market&quot;&gt;Pike Place Market&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

Today marked our last full day trekking through the Rockies, as tomorrow we start our journey back to the west coast of the United States!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On our last day here we headed to Maligne Lake and Maligne Canyon. The lake and canyon are the largest of their type in the Rockies. I was a probably a little keen donning shorts this morning as it has started to get a bit chilly. Didn’t stop us from having an energetic day trekking around the tranquil lake and fighting off annoying tourists at the canyon.  Snow is forecast for overnight - who knows what sights we’ll wake up to!</description>
