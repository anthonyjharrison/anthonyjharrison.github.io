    <richText>Apparently taking the ferry across the Atlantic from Nova Scotia to Newfoundland can be quite harrowing. Whales, ice bergs  - you name it, you could see it. Heck we&#x2019;re not that far from where the Titanic sunk and we&#x2019;re sailing on the day of the 25th anniversary that the wreckage of the Titanic was found!&#xD;Well... that drama aside our ferry crossing was quite uneventful as the weather was perfect and the sea was calm. &#xD;We arrived in Newfoundland to a beautiful sunrise and more magical weather. Steph introduced us to her hometown of Stephenville (pronounced Steph - en - ville after Steph herself). It&#x2019;s a small town blessed with scenic vistas and windy coastal roads. A slice of Tassie at the other side of the world!</richText>
