    <richText>Once upon a time the Brooklyn Bridge was the tallest structure in New York city. Those days are well and truly behind us but the allure of the bridge is still evident.&#xD;The walk over the Brooklyn Bridge took us from our adopted Brooklyn home to Manhattan. It&#x2019;s a pretty magical view but made all that more special with a stop at the famous Brooklyn Ice Creamery (which is conveniently situated at the foot of the Brooklyn side of the bridge) to refuel for the not so strenuous walk.&#xD;The weather gods blessed us with warm weather and blue sky which provided a perfect formula for photographers delight. Of course, Andrew and Anthony were more than happy to take full advantage of this. To Mariann and Felicity&#x2019;s delight (or disgust) the 2000 metre walk ended up taking close on 3 hours - but hey...we got some great pics! &#xD;</richText>
