    <richText>With eyes wide open after our stroll along the High Line (or was that just the double espressos that the Americans love to serve) we craved more from the parks of New York City. With no surprise that led us to Central Park.&#xD;We had good intentions of hiring boats or even bikes at the Boathouse to exert some energy and hopefully offset some of the three course dinners that we&#x2019;d been devouring. Unfortunately the best we could manage was a relax on the grass sharing some  Ice Cream and Champagne whilst watching NYC locals in Central Park&#x2019;s Sheep Meadow. I guess it is the thought that counts!</richText>
