    <richText>Just so we could relive the movie Hitch, we decided to go back to school and take a recreational cooking class where we would learn how to make a dinner party for guests at home. Thankfully we had someone to do all the washing up for us!&#xD;Our beer-loving instructor managed to talk our ears off whilst providing us with a few useful tips. We split into 3 groups and shared the cooking of the 9 dishes which involved lots of fun, mess making and almost a trip to the emergency ward! Deciding he was a little cold from the AC, Anthony tried to heat up by using the oven door as a leg warmer. (Don&#x2019;t worry he&#x2019;s fine!)&#xD;Once complete, we all sat down with some wine (beer for the teacher) and enjoyed our hard work. Despite being a size 0, one of the New Yorkers even went back for thirds and took home the leftovers!</richText>
