    <richText>The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Meadowlands_Stadium"&gt;New Meadowlands Stadium&lt;/a&gt; is an 85,000 seat US$1.7 billion complex. We were lucky enough to see the second game ever played there (the first was only a week earlier) with the NY Giants taking on the Pittsburg Steelers. Unfortunately the Giants went down 24 to 17.&#xD;American Football is an exceptionally interesting game - Four 15 minute quarters take about 3 hours. Obviously to allow you plenty of time to make multiple trips to the frank stand to get yourself an artery hardening ketchup, mustard and relish covered dog!&#xD;Seats were amazing though - seven rows from the front - right on 10 yard line. Great work from AJ scoring these!</richText>
